# ðŸ§  GNN Master Class (27. May 2025)

This repository contains code for simple demonstrations of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). 
These demonstrations explore the link between 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks and GCNs, and compare a custom implementation to a torch-geometric implementation.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages. You will need at least:

- `torch`
- `torch_geometric`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`

### 2. Download Dataset
The code uses two datasets:
- ECG5000
- CiteSeer

The ECG5000 dataset can be downloaded from [Time Series Classification Website](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG5000) and should be placed in a directory named `data`.
The CiteSeer dataset is downloaded automatically by the code.

### 3. Experiments
**Experiment 1**: ECG5000 (Time Series Classification)
- **Dataset**: ECG5000
- **Models**:
  - Emulate 1D-CNN using GCN with 1st order propagation
  - GCN with renormalization trick
  - 1D-CNN (baseline)
- **Objective**: Evaluate how GCNs can emulate CNN behavior for temporal signals, which "live" on linear time graph.

**Experiment 2**: CiteSeer (Node Classification)
- **Dataset**: CiteSeer citation network
- **Models**:
  - 2-layer GCN with renormalization (custom implementation)
  - 2-layer GCN with renormalization (torch-geometric implementation)
- **Objective**: Understand GCN with renormalization for node classification task. 

### 4. Run the Code
You can run the experiments by executing the main.py file. The experiment number can be specified using the `--experiment` argument, which accepts either `1` or `2`. The default is `1`.
